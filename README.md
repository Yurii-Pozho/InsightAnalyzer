# InsightAnalyzer

## Project Title: InsightAnalyzer

### Project Idea: 
InsightAnalyzer collects data from various sources to generate comprehensive reports on user activity. It gathers information about session start times, events within these sessions, and details about traffic sources, device types, and geographical locations. The goal of the project is to provide companies with a tool for deep analysis of user behavior and to optimize their web interfaces.

Uniqueness and Innovation: InsightAnalyzer automatically processes large volumes of data and offers an intuitive interface for generating analytical reports. The platform leverages artificial intelligence to identify patterns in user behavior and provides recommendations for improving the user experience.

### 1. Main Idea of the Project:
The goal is to develop a system for collecting and analyzing data on user activity on a website to optimize the user experience and increase conversions. The project involves creating interactive dashboards for data visualization and identifying key trends in user behavior.

### 2. Functionalities:
- Collection of user session data and their activity on the website.
- Data processing and integration to obtain a complete picture of user interaction.
- User behavior analysis to identify trends and patterns.
- Creation of interactive visualizations and dashboards for clear presentation of results.

### 3. Technology Stack:
- Google BigQuery (GBQ): For storing and processing large datasets.
- SQL: For querying the database and processing information.
- Tableau: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## Specific Goals:

### Data Collection:
- Collect data for each user session, including unique session IDs, geographical location, device types, languages, operating systems, traffic sources, and page entry points.
- Gather data on different event types within each session, such as product views, adding items to the cart, and initiating the purchase process.
### Data Processing:
- Build a mechanism to combine session data with event data to get a full picture of user interactions on the website.
### Analysis:
- Develop reports that allow the analysis of user behavior, identifying trends and patterns in their activity, and discovering opportunities to improve the user experience and increase conversions.
### Visualization:
- Provide visualizations and dashboards useful for marketers and analysts to quickly gather insights and make informed decisions.


## Data Storage and Analysis Tools:
The data was stored on the Google BigQuery platform, where I performed queries to process and analyze information. GBQ provides scalable infrastructure for executing SQL queries on large datasets, enabling efficient data processing.

For data analysis and visualization, I used Tableau. This tool allows creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, which help to better understand the information and detect key trends. Tableau offers powerful data aggregation, analysis, and presentation capabilities, enabling quick insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights from the Analysis:
### 1. Geographic Analysis:
Data revealed that the company has a strong presence in the US, India, and Canada, which account for the bulk of orders. This information allows the company to focus on these key markets and optimize its marketing strategies for further growth.

### 2. Seasonality Analysis:
There was a significant increase in key metrics such as orders, sessions, and conversions in December 2020 compared to other periods. This indicates seasonal demand peaks, which the company should consider in its operational and marketing plans.

### 3.Website Efficiency: 
Traffic analysis of landing pages showed that "landing_page_index.html" is the most popular among users, indicating effective optimization for attracting and retaining visitors.

### 4. Sales Funnel Analysis: 
The sales funnel revealed significant user drop-offs between the "view product" and "add to cart" stages, indicating opportunities for improving the purchasing process and user experience at this stage.

### 5. Conversion Dynamics: 
The conversion rate ranged between 1.2% and 2%, with peak values in December 2020. This information can serve as a foundation for strategies to increase conversions in the future.

## Recommendations Based on Analysis:

### Market Expansion:

- The company should consider expanding to new international markets beyond the US, India, and Canada, where high order volumes were observed.
- Conduct potential market analysis to develop an effective entry strategy.

### Seasonal Peaks Optimization:

- Investigate the reasons behind seasonal peaks, such as the sharp rise in metrics in December 2020.
- Develop strategies to prepare for seasonal fluctuations, including increasing stock and enhancing marketing efforts during peak periods.

### Website Improvement:

- Analyze the factors contributing to the popularity of "landing_page_index.html" and apply these best practices to other key pages.
- Conduct usability studies to identify and resolve site issues.

### Sales Funnel Optimization:

- Examine the reasons for user drop-offs between "view product" and "add to cart" stages and experiment with approaches to reduce them, such as simplifying the purchase process.
- Implement an analytics system to track user behavior in detail during critical funnel stages.

### Increasing Conversions:

- Continue tracking conversion metrics and testing new strategies for improvement.
- Implement a systematic approach to analyzing factors affecting conversions and respond quickly to changes.


### Conclusion:
Implementing these recommendations will enable the company to improve its operations, expand into new markets, and increase profitability.
